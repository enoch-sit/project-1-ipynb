    "## Key Concepts Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **LangGraph State Management**\n",
    "- State flows through nodes\n",
    "- `operator.add` accumulates messages\n",
    "- Complete history enables reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Agent Architecture (ReAct Pattern)**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Thought → Action → Observation → Thought → ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Thought**: LLM decides what to do\n",
    "- **Action**: Execute tools\n",
    "- **Observation**: Process results\n",
    "- **Loop**: Until task is complete\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Conditional Logic**\n",
    "- Edges can be conditional (decision points)\n",
    "- Enables dynamic workflows\n",
    "- Agent chooses its own path\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Tool Integration**\n",
    "- Tools extend agent capabilities\n",
    "- LLM decides when to use them\n",
    "- Results feed back into reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Parallel vs Sequential**\n",
    "- **Parallel**: Independent tasks done simultaneously\n",
    "- **Sequential**: Each step depends on previous results\n",
    "- LLM automatically chooses the right strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "To extend this agent, you could:\n",
    "1. **Add more tools**: Calculator, database access, API calls\n",
    "2. **Add memory**: Store conversation history across sessions\n",
    "3. **Add guardrails**: Validate tool inputs/outputs\n",
    "4. **Add human-in-the-loop**: Require approval for certain actions\n",
    "5. **Multi-agent systems**: Have multiple agents collaborate\n",
