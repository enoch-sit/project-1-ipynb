        "### Understanding `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`\n",
        "\n",
        "The `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` breaks text into smaller, manageable chunks, ideal for processing long documents in applications like language models. It prioritizes maintaining context by splitting at natural boundaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **How it Operates**: It uses a recursive method to divide text based on a set `chunk_size` (e.g., 100 characters or tokens). It starts with high-level separators like double newlines (`\\n\\n` for paragraphs) and falls back to lower-level ones (e.g., single newlines `\\n`, spaces, or characters) if the chunk exceeds the limit.\n",
        "- **What \"Recursive\" Means**: This term describes the hierarchical splitting process. Instead of cutting at a fixed point (which might split words), it tries higher-level breaks first, ensuring coherence. For instance, with a 100-character limit on a 500-character paragraph, it seeks `\\n\\n` first, then `\\n` or spaces if needed.\n",
        "- **Configurable Options**:\n",
        "  - `chunk_size`: Maximum chunk length.\n",
        "  - `chunk_overlap`: Overlap between chunks for context (e.g., 5 characters).\n",
        "  - `separators`: Custom list (default: `[\"\\n\\n\", \"\\n\", \" \", \"\"]`).\n",
        "  - `length_function`: Measures size (e.g., `len` for characters).\n",
        "- **Example**:\n",
        "  ```python\n",

        "\n",
        "The `HtmlToMarkdownTextSplitter` transforms HTML text into Markdown and splits it into chunks, perfect for web content processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **How it Works**: It converts HTML tags (e.g., `<p>` to plain text, `<h1>` to `#`) using a library like `html2text`, then applies splitting based on `chunk_size` and separators.\n",
        "- **Purpose**: Suited for scraping web pages, preserving structure (e.g., headers, lists) in Markdown.\n",
        "- **Key Feature**: Maintains semantic elements in the converted text, with splitting handled similarly to `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.\n",
        "- **Headers and Metadata**: Headers (e.g., `#` from `<h1>`) remain in the content, with no automatic metadata extraction for headers based on available documentation.\n",

        "The `MarkdownTextSplitter` splits Markdown text into chunks, respecting its structure like headers and lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **How it Works**: It divides text at natural Markdown boundaries (e.g., after `#` or `##` headers) and includes the content under each header in separate chunks, with configurable `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap`.\n",
        "- **Purpose**: Great for processing Markdown files (e.g., docs, notes) while retaining hierarchy.\n",
        "- **Key Feature**: Extracts headers into metadata for each chunk, enhancing downstream use.\n",
        "- **Evidence**: In a sample run, output shows:\n",
        "  - Chunk 0: `Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming...`, Metadata: `{'Header 1': 'Introduction to AI'}`\n",
        "  - This confirms headers are stored in `doc.metadata`.\n",

        "- **HTML to Markdown Conversion**: Tools like `HtmlToMarkdownTextSplitter` parse HTML (e.g., `<h1>Header</h1>` to `# Header`, `<a href=\"url\">Link</a>` to `[Link](url)`) using libraries such as `html2text`.\n",

        "  - **`HtmlToMarkdownTextSplitter`**: Headers stay in content (e.g., `# Header`), no metadata extraction for headers.\n",
        "  - **`MarkdownTextSplitter`**: Extracts headers into metadata (e.g., `{'Header 1': '...'}`), as evidenced by your code output.\n",
        "  - **`RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`**: No metadata, only content chunks.\n",
        "- **Clarification**: Metadata handling depends on the splitter’s design, with `MarkdownTextSplitter` uniquely supporting header metadata.\n",
